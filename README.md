# GradientBoosting_GridSearch_Python
Grid Search Assignment for a Certificate

## Gradient Booster Classifier with Grid Search

This assignment is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)). All data for this assignment has been provided through the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/), and was collated into two data files for use in training and validating the model: train.csv and test.csv

This demostrates using `GradientBoostingClassifier` and `GridSearchCV` from `sklearn`. The grid search is used to find some appropriate hyperparameters to use in the final model.
